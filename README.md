# Text Classification

## Overview
This project is a *Natural Language Processing (NLP) model* designed to classify text data into predefined categories. It utilizes a *Neural Network* to perform accurate text classification. Applications include spam detection, sentiment analysis, and topic categorization.

---

## Features
- Classifies text data into multiple categories
- Handles text preprocessing including:
  - Tokenization
  - Stopwords removal
  - Lowercasing
- Uses a *Neural Network* for classification
- Outputs predictions with evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall)

---

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- Pandas & NumPy
- Google Colab

---

## Dataset
- The dataset includes text samples with corresponding labels for training and testing.
- Preprocessing and feature extraction are applied before feeding data into the neural network.
